Un-official clickup extension. This will give you a basic preview of your assigned tasks.

I made this to speed up my workflow and hopefully you might be able to benefit from it too. :]

## Features

Current iteration lack features.

TODO: Write more

## Requirements

This extention makes out of the clickup api meaning that it requires authentication. For authentication we are just using our own personal token.

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

### Generate your personal API token

Any ClickUp user, including Guests, can generate a personal token.

1. Log into ClickUp.
2. Click on your avatar in the lower-left corner and select Apps.
3. Under API Token, click Generate.
4. You can copy and paste your personal API token wherever you need it!

### Regenerate a personal API token

You can regenerate your personal API token at any time. Your existing token will be revoked and will no longer have access to your ClickUp account.

1. Log into ClickUp.
2. Click on your avatar in the lower-left corner and select Apps.
3. Under API Token, click Regenerate.
4. Your new API token is available immediately!
